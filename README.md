# pkdir
#### To intall: 
In your terminal, run `brew tap eatspaint/pkdir; brew install pkdir`
#### To use: 
Use `pkdir` just as you would use `mkdir`, but get Pokémon instead of boring folder icons.
#### Example:
```
pkdir ~/Desktop/my_folder
```
Wow, there's a cool Pokémon on my desktop, thanks eatspaint!
