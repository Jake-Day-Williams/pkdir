# pkdir
#### Install: 
In your terminal, run `brew tap eatspaint/pkdir; brew install pkdir`

For updates, run `brew update` and then `brew upgrade pkdir`
#### Usage: 
Use `pkdir` just as you would use `mkdir`, but get Pokémon instead of boring folder icons.
```
pkdir <name> [-n]
```
`<name>` can be a new directory, or an existing file or directory
`[-n]` is an optional 3 digit flag to select a specific pokémon, by number

You can also run `pkdir -h` for help with commands.
#### Example:
```
pkdir ~/Desktop/my_folder -006
```
Wow, there's a cool Pokémon on my desktop, thanks eatspaint!
